# Introduction

Aloha Clanmate! 

Welcome to the project to build patrolling enemies. Enemies are an important part of any game as that enables the player to dodge things in game and an objective that feels challenging as well for the player.

Your enemies can have a specific health, or you can decide not to give them any. The player's health can be damaged based on a condition that interacts with the enemy.

Fir this simple one, I will show you hoe enemies can be created and made to function using a simple C# script.

So, are you excited yet?

The various steps involved in this project:

- Add the objects iin scene to create a platform
- Add enemy objects to at different positions
- Add a C# script with the enemy movement logic
