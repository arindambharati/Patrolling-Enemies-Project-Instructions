Since in this project, we just need a few platforms and enemies, we can use those assets and place them in different places in the scene.

A screenshot of a scene of our project is shown below:

You can use the 'Transform' options for GameObjects to place them appropriately in scene. This option can be used by using either the inspector to change the values manually

Or use the mouse click, drag and drop options
